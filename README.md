# Smart contract FE designer
Written in the Blazor framework. It allows the user to design front-end models, which can then be rendered by https://github.com/ancinpet/smart-contract-fe-wallet/. Created for my thesis https://github.com/ancinpet/domain-specific-languages-for-off-chain-ui-in-decentralized-applications.

Currently, only the Ethereum network is supported. This application lets you render custom front-end for Ethereum smart contracts. This application can run anywhere, in a cloud, locally, on your server as a static page. User can load his contract into it or it can be served over https and the application creates a front-end for the user, which can call Ethereum smart contracts. Supports custom validations and flows.
